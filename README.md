PNMixer-rs
==========

About
-----

Rewrite of [nickaln/pnmixer](https://github.com/nicklan/pnmixer) in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

This is meant as a drop-in replacement, but may diverge in feature set
in the future.

Installation
------------

The Rust ecosystem uses [Cargo](https://crates.io/), as such, you need
both the rust compiler and the cargo crate
(usually part of the compiler toolchain), then issue from within
the cloned repository:

```sh
cargo install
```
